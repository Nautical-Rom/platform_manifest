Nautical Rom
================
Nautical is based on the new Android Lollipop (Android L) branch and promises to be feature packed and buttery smooth. The first device in the lineup for this build will be the Google (Motorola) Nexus 6 a.k.a. shamu. Once this build is complete and things are up and running, other devices will soon follow. If you're interested in building Nautical for your Nexus 6, then please read on to find out how to sync with our repo's and run the build script.
